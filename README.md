This repository contains the code for my second project for the web developement proficiency as SDSLabs, IIT Roorkee.
This project is the implementation of Sentiment Analysis done on IMDb movie reviews data using the machine learning algorithm Stocastic Gradient Descent, which is a popular choice for out-of-core online learning.

The code can be found in the directory projec_sentiment_analyis which contains the files required to run the web app. This web app is based on Flask microframework and would require its installation to be able to run on a locad system.

To run this app, clone the repository, navigate to the projec_sentiment_analyis directory and run the conmmand 'python app.py' in the terminal.
